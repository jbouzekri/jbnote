<div>
  <p>
    Do you want to enable sync between devices ?
    You will need a Google account with the Firebase service enabled (the free plan is good enough for this app).

  <button type="button" (click)="enableSync()">Yes I want !</button><br />
  <button type="button" (click)="disableSync()">No I don't want to</button>
</div>
